 At least 39 people have died in a train collision in southern Spain and dozens more have been injured in the country's worst rail crash in more than a decade, Spain's Civil Guard has said. Rail network operator Adif said the collision happened at 19:45 local time , about an hour after the train left Málaga heading north to Madrid, when it derailed on a straight stretch of track near the city of Córdoba. The force of the crash pushed the carriages of the second train into an embankment, Puente said. There was a moment when it felt like an earthquake and the train had indeed derailed," Jimenez said. Iryo, a private rail company that operated the journey from Málaga, said around 300 passengers were on board the train that first derailed, while the other train – operated by the state-funded firm Renfe – had around 100 passengers.
